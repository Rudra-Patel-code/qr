        <p>
            The four stroke engine was first demonstrated by Nikolaus Otto in
            1876<sup><a href="bibliography.html">1</a></sup
            >, hence it is also known as the <em>Otto cycle</em>. The
            technically correct term is actually <em>four stroke cycle</em>. The
            four stroke engine is probably the most common engine type nowadays.
            It powers almost all cars and trucks.

        <p>
            The four strokes of the cycle are intake, compression, power, and
            exhaust. Each corresponds to one full stroke of the piston;
            therefore, the complete cycle requires two revolutions of the
            crankshaft to complete.
        </p>

                alt="Otto intake stroke"
            />
        </div>
        <h3>Intake</h3>
        <p>
            During the intake stroke, the piston moves downward, drawing a fresh
            charge of vaporized fuel/air mixture. The illustrated engine
            features a <em>poppet</em> intake valve which is drawn open by the
            vacuum produced by the intake stroke. Some early engines worked this
            way; however, most modern engines incorporate an extra cam/lifter
            arrangement as seen on the exhaust valve. The exhaust valve is held
            shut by a spring (not illustrated here).
        </p>

                alt="Otto compression stroke"
            />
        </div>
        <h3>Compression</h3>
        <p>
            As the piston rises, the poppet valve is forced shut by the
            increased cylinder pressure. Flywheel momentum drives the piston
            upward, compressing the fuel/air mixture.
        </p>

            />
        </div>
        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>
            At the top of the compression stroke, the spark plug fires, igniting
            the compressed fuel. As the fuel burns it expands, driving the
            piston downward.
        </p>
        <div class="step">

                alt="Otto exhaust stroke"
            />
        </div>
        <h3>Exhaust</h3>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the power stroke, the exhaust valve is opened by
            the cam/lifter mechanism. The upward stroke of the piston drives the
            exhausted fuel out of the cylinder.

        <h3>Ignition System</h3>
        <p>
            This animation also illustrates a simple ignition system using
            breaker points, coil, condenser, and battery.
        </p>
        <p>
            A number of visitors have written to point out a problem with the
            breaker points in my illustration. In this style ignition circuit,
            the spark plug will fire just as the breaker points
            <em>open.</em> The illustration appears to have this backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the illustration is correct; it just moves so fast
            it&#8217;s difficult to see! Here&#8217;s a close-up of the frames
            just at the point the plug fires:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                src="img/bkrcloseup.gif"
                title="breaker point closeup"
                alt="breaker point closeup"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            My original intent was to accurately show that the points need to
            remain closed for only a fraction of a second, called the
            <em>dwell.</em> By illustrating this, I inadvertently obscured the
            overall operation of the circuit. Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll prepare
            a more detailed illustration of the ignition system alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Larger four stroke engines usually include more than one cylinder,
            have various arrangements for the camshaft (dual, overhead, etc.),
            sometimes feature fuel injection, turbochargers, multiple valves,
            etc. None of these enhancements changes the basic operation of the
            engine.
